# Segment-Routing
Inject label module is a Linux kernel module and located in hosts (senders) to allow them to push [MPLS] labels for outgoing [TCP] packets using [SR] concept if itâ€™s needed. It takes its orders from the [SDN] controller. When the [PCE] module on controller detects congestion for a host, it calculates an alternative path, generates a stack of labels and sends it to this module.
